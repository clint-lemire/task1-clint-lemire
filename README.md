# Task 1: Code Management System and Software


## Git and Source Code Management

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a popular source code management system.
Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository, with complete history and version tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.
Git is developed primarily on Linux, although it supports most major operating systems including BSD, OS X, and Microsoft Windows.
Information about Git can be found on the project website.

http://git-scm.com/


### Action Items

* __Peruse__: [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc/) (optional).
* __Try__: [Git tutorials](http://try.github.io/).
* __Download and Install__: [Git software](http://git-scm.com/downloads) (if needed).


## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for source code management (SCM).
It is built on the Git revision control system and offers free accounts for open source and educational projects.
We will employ a Git archive for programming challenges throughout the semester.
The organization for this course is hosted on GitHub.

https://github.com/InformationScience/

Active participants are given write access to assignments.
A short list of frequently used commands appears below.


### Common Actions

* __Init__:
The `init` command creates a new local repository.
* __Clone__:
Use `clone` to instantiate a working copy from a master repository.
This is usually the first command employed to establish a local working hierarchy under this paradigm.
* __Add__:
The `add` command is used to add one or more files to staging.
Only add pertinent files to the repository.
* __Commit__:
The `commit` command incorporates changes to your working copy of the repository.
* __Push__:
The `push` command sends changes to the master branch, typically a remote repository.
* __Pull__:
The `pull` command fetches and merges changes on the remote server to the local working directory.
* __Mergetool__:
Sometimes, there may be a discrepancy between the latest version of a file and its working copy on a given host.
In such cases, the developer may need to take action to resolve these issues.
This can be achieved through normal editing, followed by the Git `add` command.
Alternatively, one can use the  `mergetool` command, which initiates a visual tool.
* __Status__:
The `status` command lists the status of working files and directories.


### Action Items

* __Account__: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a developer account (if needed).
Complete the GitHub fields `Name`, `Public email`, and upload a picture.


### GitHub Student Developer Pack (optional)

[GitHub](https://github.com/) also created the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/students) to give students free access to developer tools in one place and thereby support education.
You may want to get your pack.


## The Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org) is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability.
Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a wide variety of systems.


### Action Items

* __Peruse__: The [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org) website.


## Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an open source distribution of Python, which includes popular Python packages for data science.


### Action Items

* __Peruse__: The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) website.
* __Download and Install__: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
* __Test__: Python interpreter.


## Jupyter

The [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Notebook is a web application that can be used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.
The Notebook has support for many programming languages, including Python, R, Julia and Scala.
The Jupyter Notebook is included in the Anaconda distribution.

### Action Items

* __Run__: The Jupyter notebook.


## PyCharm (optional)

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a Python integrated development environment (IDE) for programming computer software.
It is developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com).
The educational edition is free and open source.


### Action Items
